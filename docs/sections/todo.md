# To do

With an ever morphing world, the number of potential contexts installation that could be called from increases as with the ambition of this collection. Multiple private versions of this dotfiles exist for different levels of config (simple setup of aliases only vs full ohmyzzsh configuration), so working is taking place to move this into one unified set. Therefore for now, problems in niche examples are too be expected as streamlining takes place.

- OS specific

  - windows terminal profile config

  - add automator symlink and other mac services configuration
  - add scripts to services by custom keybindings
  - add custom keybindings (transfer from snap to native)
  - amphetamine and magnets
  - docker testing

  - look at integrating https://github.com/wting/autojump/blob/master/install.py auto
  - save ubuntu settings (favorites, dock position and size etc. )

- Application specific

  - vscode sync
  - terminator config

- shell

  - make overwrite on individual configs optional e.g. own p10k zsh config
  - optional cli configure of ohmyzsh

  - option to do zsh installation automatically
  - automatic font installation

- Main setup and handling

  - improved print output control -> inform user of what is about to happen and give more warnings if dangerous, better colouring
  - update all packages script simplify
  - config file with default responses to prompts in letsgo.sh
  - configure alerts and wallpapers automatically

  - speed up shell loading, shade plugins

QUICK COMPLETELY AUTO SETUP FOR RPI AND VM MANAGEMENT <------------------------------->

- uses bash
- symlinks only


# Done but still testing

- windows powerline configs (and all windows stuff really)
- check path and completion functionality
- check bash cross compatability
- iTerm colouring
