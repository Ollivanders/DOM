## Description and Features

- Installation organised by application/OS
- anything titled "install.sh" will be run on start up
- Configures with Windows (Powerline still experimental but full WSL support), MacOS and Ubuntu

- **bin/**: Anything in `bin/` will get added to your `$PATH` and be made
  available everywhere.

- **topic/\*.bzsh**: Any files ending in `.bzsh` get loaded into your
  environment.
- **topic/path.bzsh**: Any file named `path.bzsh` is loaded first and is
  expected to setup `$PATH` or similar.
- **topic/completion.bzsh**: Any file named `completion.bzsh` is loaded
  last and is expected to setup autocomplete.

- **topic/install.sh**: Any file named `install.sh` is executed when you run `script/install`. To avoid being loaded automatically, its extension is `.sh`, not `.zsh`.
- **topic/\*.symlink**: Any file ending in `*.symlink` gets symlinked into
  your `$HOME`. This is so you can keep all of those versioned in your dotfiles
  but still keep those autoloaded files in your home directory. These get
  symlinked in when you run `script/bootstrap`.
