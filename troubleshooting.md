 # Troubleshooting 
## oh-ny-zsh or powerline not present

This means the git submodule has not been run and therefore the projects are not present

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

If that simply won't connect, try running ${DOTFILES}/bin/grsm (git remove submodules) and try again 

## Compliant directories

```
sudo chmod -R 755 /usr/local/share/zsh
sudo chown -R root:staff /usr/local/share/zsh
```

## Fonts

Run the below to configure the font and then run script/bootstrap again to re-init the .zshrc directory from the dotfiles project. This is by far the easiest solution and is recommended

```
p10k configure
```

Otherwise attempt to install the fonts manually:
```  
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install fonts-font-awesome
sudo apt-get install fonts-powerlinew
```

Direct installations of the fonts:

- https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Bold.ttf
- https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Italic.ttf
- https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Bold%20Italic.ttf

MesloGS NF might be required as well. For some terminals such as windows terminal or termintaor, configuration of this can be done in settings/preferences for the app and the font library specified.

## Font not appearing in vscode
